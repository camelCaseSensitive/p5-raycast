```

## Usage


Define a camera variable called `cam` in the setup function
```javascript
cam = createCamera();
```

The raycast function accepts three arguments:
- `rayDistance`: the length of the ray that will be cast into the 3D scene through the mouse position.
- `objectPosition`: An array `[x, y, z]` defining the position of the object you want to select in world space.
- `objectRadius`: The distance from the object's position which is considered a "hit".
```javascript
raycast(rayDistance, objectPosition, objectRadius);     // Returns a boolean
```
